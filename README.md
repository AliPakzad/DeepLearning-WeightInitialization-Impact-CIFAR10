# DeepLearning-WeightInitialization-Impact-CIFAR10
Investigate the impact of initializing all model weights to zero on its performance

Build a network with two hidden layers with layers of 50 and 50 to predict classes on the CIFAR10 dataset. Initialize the weights of all neurons in both layers to zero. Display the weights after 50 epochs. Report your analysis of the weight changes and the accuracy obtained.
